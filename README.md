PM5 Rower is an indoor rower from Concept2.
For detailed information: [https://www.concept2.com/service/indoor-rowers]

This project aims to emulate a PM5 Rower via GATT server in BLE Device, so that
any third-party applications can use the emulator to test, debug and stuffs.

## PM5 Services and Their UUIDs

| Service       | UUIDs     |
|:-------       | :----     |
| GAP           | 0x1800    |
| GATT          | 0x1801    |
| Device Info   | 0x0010    |
| Control       | 0x0020    |
| Rowing        | 0x0030    |

## Instructions to Run

Before starting the app, turn BLE service down:

```bash
sudo hciconfig hci0 down
```

Run tests and Build emulator:

```bash
make all
```

Advertise your custom PM5 service (as emulator):

```bash
sudo ./pm5-emulator
```
